I found the background turning black as the new brown-ish backdrop appears very interesting and quite a nice touch. The self portrait itself was nicely done and gave a cartoon-ish look. The user interactivity when clicking LMB to make the eyes change color, making it seem like blinking and using the cursor itself (being a red circle) to give a clown nose was clever. The use of the bezier for the eyes was also nicely done. Something that could be an interesting addition could be that everytime the user clicks their LMB, something could appear in the dark background as it fades away, for example some lightning. It could be a nice touch as it happens at the same time the self portrait blinks. I also think that the background turns black too fast and then we just have the brown slowly overtaking it, giving too much time in between transitions. So I would slow down the transition to brown itself and then also slow down the dark background change.

I found that giving the user the choice between two options was a fun touch. When clicking on any of the options, the screen starts to split, transitioning to the option picked by the user and a new drawn figure appears. This storytelling creates emotion within the project, rather than just a plain one. A representation showing the user a drawn figure that represents the option they chose, which was a clever idea and nicely done, especially with the slow transition. There is also the use of an audio track as the scene transitions which enhances the experience, helping it not feel dull. To finish, the cursor dragging the diamond around was a little rigid, maybe could let the diamond itself breathe while the user moves around with maybe a mini-diamond as the cursor!

I found the user interaction very interesting. To be able to draw on top of the self portrait and give it your own look. It really enhances the user experience because you can redo it so many times to give the project multiple looks. One thing that could be an exciting addition would be to be able to erase what you've drawn in case you make a mistake (if that is possible). The addition of a text box explaining how the project works was a nice touch as well. It is a very user-friendly project.
