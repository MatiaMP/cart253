This project was simple but for some reason challenging as we only had 1 life, once we eat the red fly it is game over which is harsh. It could be fun to have 3 lives in which each time the frog eats a red fly, it loses a life until the 3rd one, or even a health bar that goes down when the frog eats a red fly and up when it eats a normal fly. In the code, something that seems small but that is important is to clearly indicate what is what. For example, "psnbug" might not be clear to everyone, something like "poisonBug" or "psnBug" if you really want to use "psn" would be more clear. Adding a restart button or a keybind to restart the game once it is over would enhance the user experience. You could also add some sound to enhance the user experience. Overall the pace of the game was good. I also really liked the hunger bar and the code and I feel inspired to use one myself.

This project was interesting, I enjoyed the introduction screen displaying the text and it changing. I wasn't able to succesfully complete the game, it felt impossible. The fly movement was super well done and made it difficult to eat. Adding a restart button or a keybind to restart the game once it is over would enhance the user experience. In my opinion there is a lot of code that could be shortened so that there isn't that many lines. In the code itself, I enjoyed the pollution and health bars. I appreciated the game over screen that showcases your stats, such as flies eaten and fairies eaten.

To start, some instructions on the start/introduction screen would be helpful to the user to help understand  what the goal of the game is and how to play. The timer is an interesting aspect but I wasn't too sure what I was being timed on, was it just to eat as many flies as I could in 10 seconds? It is my first time seeing a timer going down for the duration of the game so it was interesting to see it in the code by using "let baseGameDurationMs = 10000" to make it 10 seconds. I wasn't sure know how to beforehand. I felt that the overall pace of the game could be a little quicker by adding more flies on the screen at a time rather than just one. You can use an Array function in your code for instance.The fly movement was interesting, using the lerp() function. The wing movement was also intriguing, using sin(). I also enjoyed the game over screen, showcasing your current score as well as your best score, giving in to the self competition aspect.
