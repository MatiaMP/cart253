## Description

> *Waves* is a version of the frog game I made. But in this variation, there is a timer that was added of 30 seconds as well as a boss that spawns, it takes 3 tongue hits to eat the boss which will give the user 5 points. If the boss hits the frog, it will deduct 5 points. The user wins at 15 points and loses at -15 points. Controls: Mouse or arrow keys to move, left click or spacebar to shoot tongue out.

> *Absorb* is a version of the frog game I made. But in this variation, instead of using its tongue to eat, the user must use the frogs body to interact with the food. The user must reach a score of 20 to win, and -20 to lose. Move around with the arrow keys or with the mouse. Controls: move frog around with arrow keys or with mouse.
