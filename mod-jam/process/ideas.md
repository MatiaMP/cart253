# Mod Jam Ideas

1. Frog is a human
2. Human is a picky eater
3. Human only likes unhealthy foods such hotdogs (+2pts) and burgers (+1pt)
4.  does not like healthy foods such as broccoli (-2pts), carrots (-1pt)
5. Human flashes green (good) when human eats something unhealthy, score goes up depending on what human eats (+2 if human eats a hotdog, +1 if human eats a burger)
6. Human flashes red (bad) when human eats something healthy, score goes down depending on what human eats (-2 if human eats a broccoli, -1 if human eats a carrot)
7. Score is in the top right of the canvas
8. Human becomes faster when it eats something it likes
9. Human becomes slower when it eats something it does not like
10. Human becomes bigger every time it eats something it likes
11. Human becomes smaller every time it eats something it doesnt like
12. Background changes color depending on the score (it will start off white (maybe) but slight change to lighter, more pastel colors if it eats unhealthy foods, and change to dark colors if it eats healthy foods)
13. Unhealthy foods are faster, more difficult to get (since these foods are what we are aiming for, they move quicker across the screen, making it more difficult to grab)
14. Healthy foods are slower, more obtainable to make it difficult (they move slower across the screen, making it easier to grab)
15. Multiple foods are coming into the screen at the same time
16. When Human eats unhealthy food, there is a positive sound effect
17. When Human eats healthy food, there is a negative sound effect
18. Each time Human eats any food, there is a munching sound effect (healthy or unhealthy)
19. Tongue changes color when it grabs food (maybe green for unhealthy and red for unhealthy)
20. Game ends when Human has filled most of the screen from eating the unhealthy foods (visuals and score to be determined when testing) OR when Human has eaten too many healthy foods in a row (visuals and score to be determined when testing as well)
